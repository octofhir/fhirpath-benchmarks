## Tasks

### 3.1 Data Layer and API Integration

  - JSON file loader for static results
  - Data validation and error handling
  - Caching mechanism for performance
- [ ] Create data transformation utilities:
  - Convert raw results to display format
  - Calculate derived metrics (pass rates, performance ratios)
  - Handle missing or incomplete data

### 3.2 Results Dashboard Implementation
- [ ] Create main dashboard layout component
- [ ] Implement overview statistics cards:
  - Total test cases count
  - Implementation comparison summary
  - Latest benchmark run timestamp
  - Overall pass rate across implementations
- [ ] Build implementation comparison table:
  - Sortable columns (name, pass rate, avg execution time)
  - Color-coded performance indicators
  - Expandable rows for detailed metrics
  - Export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Add summary charts:
  - Pass rate comparison bar chart
  - Performance comparison radar chart
  - Test category breakdown pie chart
- [ ] Implement real-time data refresh mechanism

### 3.3 Individual Implementation Pages
- [ ] Create dynamic routing for `/benchmarks/:implementation`
- [ ] Design implementation detail page layout:
  - Header with implementation metadata
  - Performance metrics section
  - Test results section
  - Historical trends section
- [ ] Implement detailed metrics display:
  - Execution time statistics (min, max, avg, median)
  - Memory usage patterns
  - Success/failure breakdown by test category
  - Error analysis and common failure patterns
- [ ] Add performance visualization:
  - Execution time distribution histogram
  - Memory usage over time line chart
  - Test category performance comparison
- [ ] Create test case drill-down functionality:
  - Expandable test case list
  - Individual test result details
  - Error message display for failed tests

### 3.4 Filtering and Search System
- [ ] Implement global search functionality:
  - Search by implementation name
  - Search by test case name/description
  - Search by error messages
- [ ] Create advanced filtering sidebar:
  - Filter by implementation language
  - Filter by test category/tags
  - Filter by pass/fail status
  - Filter by performance metrics ranges
- [ ] Add sorting capabilities:
  - Sort by performance metrics
  - Sort by pass rate
  - Sort by implementation name
  - Sort by last updated timestamp
- [ ] Implement filter state management:
  - URL-based filter persistence
  - Filter combination logic
  - Clear filters functionality

### 3.5 Test Case Explorer
- [ ] Create `/tests` route and page component
- [ ] Implement test case listing:
  - Paginated test case table
  - Test metadata display (name, description, tags)
  - FHIRPath expression preview
  - Expected results display
- [ ] Add test case detail view:
  - Full test case information
  - Input data preview
  - Results across all implementations
  - Performance comparison for specific test
- [ ] Implement test case categorization:
  - Group by functionality (arithmetic, logic, etc.)
  - Group by complexity level
  - Group by data type operations

### 3.6 Navigation and User Experience
- [ ] Implement responsive navigation header:
  - Logo and branding
  - Main navigation menu
  - Search bar integration
  - Mobile hamburger menu
- [ ] Create breadcrumb navigation:
  - Dynamic breadcrumbs based on current route
  - Clickable navigation history
- [ ] Add loading states and skeletons:
  - Table loading skeletons
  - Chart loading animations
  - Page transition loading indicators
- [ ] Implement error boundaries and error pages:
  - 404 page for invalid routes
  - Error fallback components
  - Network error handling

### 3.7 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement data virtualization for large tables:
  - Virtual scrolling for test case lists
  - Lazy loading of detailed results
- [ ] Add memoization for expensive calculations:
  - Memoize statistical calculations
  - Cache filtered and sorted data
- [ ] Optimize bundle size:
  - Code splitting by routes
  - Lazy load chart components
  - Tree shake unused dependencies
- [ ] Implement progressive loading:
  - Load critical data first
  - Background loading of secondary data

### 3.8 Accessibility and SEO
- [ ] Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance:
  - Proper ARIA labels and roles
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Screen reader compatibility
  - Color contrast validation
- [ ] Implement SEO optimization:
  - Meta tags for each page
  - Structured data markup
  - Sitemap generation
  - Open Graph tags for social sharing
- [ ] Add internationalization support:
  - Text externalization
  - Number and date formatting
  - RTL language support preparation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard loads and displays all implementations correctly
- [ ] Individual implementation pages show detailed metrics and charts
- [ ] Filtering and search work across all data dimensions
- [ ] Test case explorer allows browsing and detailed inspection
- [ ] All components are responsive and accessible
- [ ] Performance meets targets (< 2s initial load, < 500ms interactions)
- [ ] Error handling is robust and user-friendly
- [ ] SEO score > 90 on Lighthouse

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 foundation components completed
- Enhanced JSON data format from Rust runner (can use mock data initially)
- Mantine UI Kit 8 components
- React Router v6

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all utility functions and data transformations
- Integration tests for data fetching and filtering
- Visual regression tests for charts and tables
- Accessibility testing with automated tools
- Performance testing with large datasets

## Estimated Time: 2.5 weeks

## Notes
- Focus on core functionality first, polish in later phases
- Use mock data initially if Rust runner is not ready
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness from the start
- Document all component APIs for future development
- Consider user feedback mechanisms for future improvements
