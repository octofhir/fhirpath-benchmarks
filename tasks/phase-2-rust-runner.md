# Phase 2: Rust Test Runner (Weeks 2-3)

## Status: ðŸš§ In Progress (Major Components Complete)

## Overview
Develop a Rust-based test runner to replace the existing Python script (`run-comparison.py`) with enhanced performance, better error handling, and improved JSON output format.

## Tasks

### 2.1 Rust Project Setup âœ…
- [x] Create new Rust project in `comparison/runner/` directory
- [x] Set up Cargo.toml with required dependencies:
  - `serde` and `serde_json` for JSON handling
  - `tokio` for async operations
  - `clap` for command-line interface
  - `anyhow` for error handling
  - `chrono` for timestamp handling
  - `uuid` for unique identifiers
- [x] Configure project structure:
  ```
  runner/
  â”œâ”€â”€ src/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.rs
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ runner.rs
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ implementations/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ results.rs
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.rs
  â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
  â””â”€â”€ README.md
  ```

### 2.2 Configuration Management âœ…
- [x] Create configuration struct for test runner settings
- [x] Implement configuration loading from JSON file
- [x] Add support for environment variable overrides
- [x] Create validation for configuration parameters
- [x] Add support for implementation-specific configurations

### 2.3 Test Case Processing
- [ ] Implement test case loader for specs/fhirpath/tests/*.json files
- [ ] Create test case validation and filtering
- [ ] Add support for test case categorization and tagging
- [ ] Implement test case dependency resolution
- [ ] Add parallel test case processing capabilities

### 2.4 Implementation Runners
- [ ] Create abstract trait for language implementation runners
- [ ] Implement runners for each language:
  - [ ] JavaScript/Node.js runner
  - [ ] Python runner (with virtual environment support)
  - [ ] Java/Maven runner
  - [ ] C#/.NET runner
  - [ ] Go runner
  - [ ] Clojure runner
  - [ ] Rust runner (for fhirpath-rs)
- [ ] Add setup and teardown procedures for each implementation
- [ ] Implement timeout and resource limit handling

### 2.5 Enhanced Result Collection
- [ ] Design improved JSON result format with:
  - Execution timing (setup, execution, teardown)
  - Memory usage statistics
  - CPU usage metrics
  - Error details and stack traces
  - Test metadata and environment info
- [ ] Implement result aggregation and comparison
- [ ] Add statistical analysis (mean, median, percentiles)
- [ ] Create result validation and consistency checks

### 2.6 Benchmarking Features
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking with multiple runs
- [ ] Add warmup iterations for JIT-compiled languages
- [ ] Collect detailed performance metrics:
  - Execution time distribution
  - Memory allocation patterns
  - GC pressure (for applicable languages)
- [ ] Implement benchmark result comparison and regression detection

### 2.7 Command Line Interface
- [ ] Create CLI with subcommands:
  - `run` - Execute tests for specific implementations
  - `benchmark` - Run performance benchmarks
  - `compare` - Generate comparison reports
  - `validate` - Validate test cases and configurations
- [ ] Add filtering options (by implementation, test category, tags)
- [ ] Implement progress reporting and verbose output
- [ ] Add dry-run mode for testing configurations

### 2.8 Output Generation
- [ ] Generate enhanced JSON results compatible with website
- [ ] Create comparison report with statistical analysis
- [ ] Implement result archiving and versioning
- [ ] Add export formats (CSV, HTML summary)
- [ ] Generate performance regression reports

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rust runner produces identical results to Python runner for existing test cases
- [ ] All language implementations are supported and working
- [ ] Enhanced JSON format includes timing and memory metrics
- [ ] CLI interface is intuitive and well-documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are accurate and reproducible
- [ ] Error handling is robust with clear error messages
- [ ] Code follows Rust best practices and guidelines

## Dependencies
- Rust 1.70+
- All existing language implementation dependencies
- Access to specs/fhirpath/tests/ directory
- Existing test-config.json format

## Migration Strategy
1. Develop Rust runner alongside existing Python runner
2. Validate output compatibility with extensive testing
3. Run both runners in parallel during transition period
4. Gradually migrate CI/CD to use Rust runner
5. Deprecate Python runner after successful migration

## Performance Targets
- 50% faster execution compared to Python runner
- Reduced memory usage during test execution
- Better resource utilization with parallel processing
- More accurate timing measurements

## Estimated Time: 1.5 weeks

## Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing result format during transition
- Focus on reliability and accuracy over speed optimizations initially
- Document all configuration options and CLI usage
- Consider future extensibility for new language implementations
