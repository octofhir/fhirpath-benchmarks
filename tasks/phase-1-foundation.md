# Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)

## Status: Not Started

## Overview
Set up the foundational infrastructure for the FHIRPath benchmarking website including FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) project structure, tooling, and basic components following modern frontend architecture principles.

## Tasks

### 1.1 FSD Project Structure Setup
- [ ] Create new React 19 project with Vite
- [ ] Configure TypeScript with strict mode
- [ ] Set up FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) directory structure:
  ```
  website/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── app/                    # App layer - initialization, providers, routing
  │   ├── pages/                  # Pages layer - route components
  │   ├── widgets/                # Widgets layer - composite UI blocks
  │   ├── features/               # Features layer - business logic slices
  │   ├── entities/               # Entities layer - business entities
  │   └── shared/                 # Shared layer - reusable resources
  ├── public/
  └── docs/
  ```
- [ ] Set up TypeScript path mapping for FSD layers in `tsconfig.json`
- [ ] Configure Vite to support FSD path aliases
- [ ] Create index.ts files for proper re-exports in each layer
- [ ] Initialize Git repository for website code

### 1.2 Development Tooling
- [ ] Install and configure Biome for linting and formatting
- [ ] Set up Biome configuration file (biome.json) with FSD-aware rules
- [ ] Configure VS Code settings for Biome and FSD integration
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality and FSD compliance
- [ ] Configure Vite build optimization settings with FSD path resolution

### 1.3 Mantine UI Kit Integration
- [ ] Install Mantine UI Kit 8 and dependencies
- [ ] Install Mantine Charts for data visualization
- [ ] Set up Mantine theme provider
- [ ] Configure Mantine CSS variables
- [ ] Create base theme configuration

### 1.4 FSD App Layer Setup (Routing and Providers)
- [ ] Install and configure React Router v6
- [ ] Create `app/providers/` with:
  - `ThemeProvider.tsx` - Mantine theme configuration
  - `RouterProvider.tsx` - React Router setup
  - `index.ts` - Combined providers export
- [ ] Set up `app/router/` with:
  - `routes.tsx` - Route definitions following FSD pages layer
  - `index.ts` - Router configuration
- [ ] Create basic routing structure:
  - `/` - Landing page (pages/landing)
  - `/dashboard` - Results dashboard (pages/dashboard)
  - `/benchmarks/:implementation` - Individual benchmark pages (pages/benchmark-detail)
  - `/tests` - Test case explorer (pages/test-explorer)
- [ ] Set up `app/styles/` for global styles and theme customization

### 1.5 Design System Foundation
- [ ] Research Linear Design System principles
- [ ] Create design tokens file (colors, typography, spacing)
- [ ] Set up CSS custom properties for theming
- [ ] Create base component styles following Linear Design
- [ ] Implement responsive breakpoints

### 1.6 FSD Shared Layer Foundation
- [ ] Set up `shared/ui/` with reusable UI components:
  - Button variants (wrapping Mantine components)
  - Card components with consistent styling
  - Loading states and skeletons
  - Error boundaries and error displays
- [ ] Create `shared/lib/` with utility functions:
  - Common hooks and helpers
  - Constants and configuration
  - Type definitions and interfaces
- [ ] Set up `shared/api/` infrastructure:
  - Base API client configuration
  - Error handling utilities
- [ ] Create placeholder pages in `pages/` layer for all routes
- [ ] Implement basic navigation in `widgets/navigation-header/`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project builds without errors with FSD structure
- [ ] Biome linting passes with zero issues including FSD rules
- [ ] FSD layer structure is properly implemented with correct import/export patterns
- [ ] TypeScript path mapping works correctly for all FSD layers
- [ ] All routes are accessible and render placeholder content from pages layer
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Mantine components render correctly through shared/ui layer
- [ ] Design system tokens are properly applied across FSD layers
- [ ] FSD import rules are enforced (layers can only import from layers below them)
- [ ] Each FSD layer has proper index.ts files for public API exports

## Dependencies
- Node.js 22+
- React 19
- Mantine UI Kit 8
- Biome
- Vite
- TypeScript with path mapping support

## Estimated Time: 2 weeks

## Notes
- Focus on establishing solid FSD foundation for future development
- Ensure all tooling is properly configured with FSD compliance before moving to next phase
- Document FSD setup process and conventions for future developers
- Reference the dedicated FSD implementation task for detailed architecture guidance
- Start with shared and app layers as they form the foundation for other layers
